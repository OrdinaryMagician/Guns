### Guns.u
#### (Because there is no such thing as "too many guns")

--

Guns.u is a small UT'99 mod highly inspired by the basic concept of
[shotguns.pk7](http://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=45225): Bleeding
makes guns drop, and those guns fire automatically.

Where shotguns.pk7 had shotguns (a spinoff, chainguns.pk7, had chainguns),
Guns.u has ALL weapons in the game (except the translocator because it doesn't
make any sense to add it in).

Guns.u also has different behavior for the gun drops. These flying killing
machines will bounce off walls, respond to hit damage, slide down slopes (not
yet implemented) and much much more. The can also fire prematurely while
flying, so be careful!

Guns.u provides extensive configuration through Guns.ini, there you can tweak
more or less everything tweakable about the mod (duh). You can also configure
it in-game through the console thanks to the magic of "get" and "set", if you
know the class and variable names.

Guns.u uses code from some older projects, such as SWWM or the Zanaveth Ultra
Suite. Since I am still technically the author of those, I don't have to give
anyone credit. :V
